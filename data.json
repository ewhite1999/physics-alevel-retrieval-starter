    "Question": "Describe the evidence that neutrinos exist",
    "Answer": "Experimental data shows that as a beta particle is emitted in beta decay it will have a range of energies from nearly zero up to a maximum. All decays must have the same energy.(conservation of energy). The total energy and momentum of the beta particle and recoiling nucleus was not constant. Energy has to be conserved Wolfgang  predicted a particle that could carry away the extra energy/momentum so they would be conserved."

    "Answer": "Fluorescent tubes contain mercury vapour across which a high p.d. is applied. The high voltage accelerates free electrons. The free electrons collide with the mercury atoms and excites them to a higher energy level. When these electrons relax they lose high energy photons in the UV range. A phosphorous coating on the inside of the tube absorbs these photons, which excites the electrons to a higher energy level. These electrons then relax and release lower energy photons of visible light."

    "Answer": "Vary the length 8 times. Measure the time period. Keep mass of the pendulum bob a control variable. make the experiment more accurate by repeat reading, timing for 10 oscillations and reduce parallax errors by keeping your eye level with the start and end of an oscillation. Plot a graph of T^2 against l. Relationship is proven if the graph is a straight line through the origin."

    "Question": "Why does light and heavy damping take place within an exponential envelope?",
    "Answer": "At the start the oscillator has the maximum energy and maximum kinetic energy (as it passes through the mid point)As the oscillator is moving the quickest is has the largest value of air resistance. The large air resistance cause energy to be lost quickly (gradient decreases quickly)As the oscillator loses energy it slows down. This means air resistance decreases and energy is lost as a slower rate. (gradient becomes less steep)"

Initially there are lots of electrons, lots of repulsion so electrons leave quickly. As there are now less electrons on the plate, there is less repulsion and so electrons leave the plate at a slower rate. As voltage is proportional to charge it follows the same relationship."
