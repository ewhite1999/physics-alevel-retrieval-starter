    "Answer": "Similarities - both change a nuclear proton to a neutron and simultaneously causes the emission of an electron neutrino. Differences - In electron-proton collision the electron is the particle that's acting because its being fired at a proton so the W boson comes from the electron. It must be the W- to conserve charge. With electron capture the exchange particle is the W+ from the proton."

    "Answer": "Fluorescent tubes contain mercury vapour across which a high p.d. is applied. The high voltage accelerates free electrons. The free electrons collide with the mercury atoms and excites them to a higher energy level. When these electrons relax they lose high energy photons in the UV range. A phosphorous coating on the inside of the tube absorbs these photons, which excites the electrons to a higher energy level. These electrons then relax and release lower energy photons of visible light."

Initially there are lots of electrons, lots of repulsion so electrons leave quickly. As there are now less electrons on the plate, there is less repulsion and so electrons leave the plate at a slower rate. As voltage is proportional to charge it follows the same relationship."

    "Answer": "When a capacitor is uncharged it is initially easy to add electrons onto the first plate (so charge increases quickly). As the first plate is now negative it is harder to add electrons due to the electrostatic repulsion. Electrons are now added but at a slower rate (charge increases but at a slower rate). As voltage is proportional to charge it follows the same relationship."

    "Question": "Why would a pendulum bob that swings through a magnetic field be heavily damped?",
    "Answer": "Pendulum bob cuts through magnetic field which induces a voltage across metal bob. Currents circulate in bob (eddy currents). Current produced a magnetic field. Current will always produce a magnetic field that apposes the motion that created it ( Lenz's Law). Magnetic fields (from current and permanent magnets) interact and dampen motion."

    "Question": "Explain why transformers are not 100 % efficient.",
    "Answer": "Induced emf in iron core which allows a current to flow which creates heat energy. Lenz's Law means induced current which create a magnetic field that opposes the change. Heat is also produced by the resistance in the coils. Not all the flux from the primary coil will pass through the secondary coil. "
